@class Car;

@interface Person : NSObject

@property (nonatomic) NSString *name;

// The weak attribute creates a non-owning relationship to
// car. This allows john to have a reference to hyundai while
// avoiding a retina cycle. Should hyundai be destroyed while
// john still has a reference to it, the attribute car will be
// set to nil to avoid a dangling pointer.

// A common use case for the weak attribute is parent-child
// data structures. By convention, the parent object should
// maintain a strong reference with itâ€™s children, and the
// children should store a weak reference back to the parent.
